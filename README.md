Pet Management System 
Developed and optimized a Java-based database management application using JDBC, focusing on improving code efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.
Implemented best practices such as modular design, exception handling, and resource management through try-with-resources and connection pooling.
Enhanced database interaction by refactoring CRUD operations and applying clean coding principles to ensure robust and reliable data access. 
This project strengthened my understanding of Java-JDBC integration, database connectivity, and performance optimization in real-world applications.
